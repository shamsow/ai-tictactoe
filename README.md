# AI-TacTacToe

Play TicTacToe against an AI!

This `Flask` app uses `Flask-SocketIO` to communicate with the `Python` backend.
The frontend is written using `JavaScript` and handles rendering and updating the board.

The `Python` backend utilises the `minimax` algorithm to generate the optimal AI moves.
